This package introduces a polygon selection tool into rVIZ, this tool creates a vector of goals which enforces to make the turtlebot follow a boustrophedon path in the search of landmines.

## TODO:

* move_goal -> Actionclient and Actionserver.

* A rough plan is in the works regarding this matter

* Splitting the client up into client and server (currently resides as a client only).

* Cleaning up the code, massive clean up of unused function and maybe adding pointers and/or references to speed up runtime.


## Further implementation:
* Add implementation of metal_detector





## This package is dependent on:

    Basic ros packages:
    turtlebot2
    gmapping
    amcl
    rviz

    Other ros packages:
    soundplay
